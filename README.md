# shinydashboard_infoboxes

A complete example for using shinydashboard infoboxes and valueboxes in a Shiny project.

## Overview

Info and value boxes are ways to display information graphically within a Shiny app. This example includes 3 rows of the same box, each with a slight difference. The first box on the left is created statically - meaning it is established on the UI side and thus cannot change once the code is rendered into HTML. The other boxes are rendered dynamically meaning a placeholder is put in the UI and allows for updates from teh server side.

### Code

Shinydashboard is required. Intall the package:

```
install.packages("shinydashboard")
```

To run this example:
```

```
